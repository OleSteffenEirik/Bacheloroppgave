:poop:

This bachelorthesis outline a web portal for ordering parts via email. Customers will get a overview of their own machines, so they can read PDF-documentation that are connected to it and also se a 3D model of each machine. Further the customers can search for the specific ID on the parts that are attached to the specified machine, so they can add it to the shopping cart. From the shopping cart the customers can check out. This will generate a formated email with the needed information, that both the customer and the seller will recieve. After that the business is agreed on email between each part.
